\section{Product concept: Radio Frequency Camera Assisted Rover (RFCAR)}
\label{sec:orge7b0dc6}
The envisioned product consists of a remote controlled car used to assist
exploration and maintenance domains. For this purpose, the vehicle should contain a
remotely operated camera feeding back video to the user.
Additionally, the
vehicle must contain odometric sensors to assist in driving and prevent
crashes when user is not in control, e.g., when connection is lost.
The vehicle can be used for exploration of unaccessible areas to human operators
like fluid pipelines and other hazardous sites.
